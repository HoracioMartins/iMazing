- What was your workflow to build the web page?
I started by analyzing all the elements that were sent to me and then started to planned how I would set up the structure of the page.
Since it was a page with only header, 3 blocks with text and image, I decided that I would first develop the desktop version and then the mobile version. 
When I was doing the desktop implementation I had to at the same time start creating the css, make sure it was being SEO friendly and then move on to the mobile version. 
After finishing the development, had to do make some test to see if the site was responsive, fast and lightweight. I also did a code review in order to make some optimizations.

- Did you use any tools/libraries and why did you use them?
For coding I used Visual Studio Code and for performance and testing I used Chrome DevTools and PageSpeed Insights. 
Boostrap for the icons and help to make the page more responsive and also reduce the implementation time due to predefined classes. 

- How did you make sure that the page is SEO-friendly?
Use of semantic tags of HTML 5 for better descriptions of page component.
Using meta description tag that can be show on the search result snippets.
Use of the alt attribute in images, so the users can understand the image when it cannot be viewed.
Title tag with the keywords that will help it appear in search results.
Heading (H1-H6) to structure the page for both the reader and search engines.

- If you had more time, what would you do to further improve the web page (code cleanliness, performance, etc.)?
Work more on some Queries. 
Pass the CSS to SCSS and minify.
Better optimization of images through AVIF.
